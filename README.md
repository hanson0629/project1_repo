OVERVIEW:

In this project, we compared Bitcoin's price growth since 2010 to other commodities like Gold and Crude Oil. We were able to collect data from various sources for these commodities and compare the statistics to come to a conclusion about which is a better and safer buy. At the end of the presentation, we will be able to discuss 

This was a learning project for us that helped us study Bitcoin and it's growth over the years compared to other traditional commodities and ETFs.

**What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is a digital asset or a form of payment that can be exchanged online for goods and services. Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called blockchain. A blockchain represents a network of blocks which each hold several transactions. Each new block is validated by the one which precedes it, therefore it is virtually impossible to falsify the blockchain. The use of a cryptocurrency moves past the traditional centralized money transfer structure which requires institutions and central entities to facilitate the movement of money. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies creates an internet of value which allows monetary data to flow just as easy as information. 


**Why are cryptocurrencies so popular?

-Supporters see cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as the currency of the future and are racing to buy them now, presumably before they become more valuable.
-Some supporters like the fact that cryptocurrency removes central banks from managing the money supply, since over time these banks tend to reduce the value of money via inflation.
-Other supporters like the technology behind cryptocurrencies, the blockchain, because it’s a decentralized processing and recording system and can be more secure than traditional payment systems.
-Some speculators like cryptocurrencies because they’re going up in value and have no interest in the currencies’ long-term acceptance as a way to move money.

**Should I buy Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is an incredibly speculative and volatile buy. Stock trading of established companies is generally less risky than investing in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin
