#### **4. What is Bitcoin’s growth prospect? And is it a viable investment? 

Bitcoin’s growth prospect would need to be gauged against a regulated growth ETF to prove its viability as an investment. Our Data Analysis shows that its distribution is spread much wider than iShares ETF indicating the significant risk involved in Bitcoin given its growth.

#### **5. What is Bitcoin's comparison with traditional asset classes based on their returns, volatility, and volume in the the past 5 years? (Bitcoin vs Other Traditional Assets and Indices)

Bitcoin can be seen as an outlier based on the bubble chart with 5yr avg return as the y-axis and joined volatility as the x-axis. Based on the observation, the major equity indices including S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones are considered relatively stable placing them in the bottom left corner in terms of returns and volatility. Crude is relatively volatile with a sharp drop during March 2020 that primarily affected the volatility. Given what was examined, Bitcoin knocks them out of the park with all three variables considered (return, volatility, volume).
